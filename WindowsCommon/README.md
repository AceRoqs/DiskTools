_WindowsCommon_ is a shared library for building Windows applications.  Largely, this means
providing RAII resources, but also includes facilities for HRESULT exceptions,
OutputDebugString tracing, and application window management (among other things).

_WindowsCommon_ has a dependency on the _PortableRuntime_ library.
